A small project that demonstrates how to implement a basic, single-buffered falling sand model. You can watch a video tutorial about this project on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/4zcFqAxH_BA).

Press keys 1-4 (not the numpad keys!) to switch between four implementations of the model. The tutorial video explains the changes in each implementation and how everything works. The basic model only has sand and air, but it is enough to get you started with creating falling sand and cellular automata models of your own.
